# Definition: https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/solution/
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
